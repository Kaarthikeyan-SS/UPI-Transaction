# UPI Flow Dashboard â€“ Power BI Analytics Project

This Power BI project focuses on analyzing UPI (Unified Payments Interface) transaction flows from customers to merchants. The goal is to derive actionable insights about digital payment patterns, bank interactions, device usage, and customer behavior based on real transaction data.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Objective

With UPI being a dominant digital payment method in India, understanding how transactions behave across banks, devices, and users is crucial for both financial institutions and fintech platforms.

This dashboard answers questions like:
- Which banks are most active as **senders** and **receivers**?
- What is the **success rate** of UPI transactions?
- How do customers prefer to pay â€” QR Code, UPI ID, or Phone Number?
- Are there noticeable trends based on **customer age, gender, and city**?
- What devices are most commonly used for digital payments?
